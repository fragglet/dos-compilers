       Block Command

To use any BLOCK COMMAND the block must be marked first. This is done 
with the Ctrl-[ (begin block) and Ctrl-] (end block) commands. Then any 
of the following are valid.

Copy      -  Copies marked block to the cursor.
Delete    -  Deletes marked block.
Move      -  Inserts the marked block at the cursor and deletes it
             from its previous position.
Print     -  Sends the marked block to the PRN: device.
Read      -  Reads a files at the cursor.
Write     -  Writes the marked block to a file.
Beginning -  Moves the cursor to the beginning of the block.
End       -  Moves the cursor to the end of the block.
.03

            Block Write

Write requests the name of a file.  It then writes the previously 
marked  block  of text to that file.   No change is made  to  the 
text.

.04

            Block Read

Unlike  the  other  block  commands,  read  does  not  act  on  a 
previously  marked  block.   Read  requests a filename  and  then 
inserts the text of that file into the current text at the cursor 
position.   If  the  file does not exist,  an  error  message  is 
displayed.

.06

            Project Command

The  Close  menu contains the commands used by LSE to  finish  an 
editing session with the text of a certain window.

Quit     -  Closes the current window. If Only one window is present
            LSE is exited.
Save     -  Saves the file in the current window and closes that window.
            Quits if only one window was present.
Continue -  Save the file in the current window and allows you to 
            Continue editing that file.
Next     -  Saves the current file and prompts for a new file. If no
            new file is specified LSE will close that window.
Open     -  Abandons the current file and prompts for a new file.
Rename   -  Prompts you for a new name for the current file.
Insert   -  Inserts a file at the cursor.
Display  -  Displays the filenames of all files in memory.
Macros   -  Goto Macro menu (Save and Load).

                 Searching

Searching for strings of patterns is possible in LSE. The mode menu
allows you to select the search you desire. After hitting the search
key you will be prompted as to what string or pattern to search for.
Hitting the Mode Menu key at this prompt will cause LSE to search 
backwards. To repeat a previous search just hit the search again
key (ESC).

.15

                Search and Replace

Searching for strings of patterns is possible in LSE. The mode menu
allows you to select the search you desire. After hitting the search
and replace key you will be prompted as to what string or pattern to 
search for, followed by a prompt for the replacement string.
Hitting the Mode Menu key at the search prompt will cause LSE to search 
backwards. After answering the two prompts you wil be asked if you
want to be prompted before each replacement is made. Simply Hit P for 
Prompt or N for No Prompt. To repeat a previous search and replace just 
hit the search again key (ESC).

.09

                   Fork Command Processor

The fork command processor function clears the screen and invokes 
the  command  processor,  allowing the user to access any  needed 
system  function.   LSE  alters your system prompt by  adding   
<LSE>  in front of it.   This is to remind you that a copy  of 
LSE  is  running  under the currently loaded  command  processor. 
Entering  EXIT at the command level will return the user  to  the 
current character in LSE.



.10

                 Go To Line Number 

When  a  file  is  loaded into a window,  each  line  is  ordered 
numerically.  As text is added or deleted, LSE keeps track of the 
current  line numbers.   When the current line number command  is 
executed, you are asked to input the line number that you want to 
be changed to be the current line number.  If the line associated 
with the number exists,  the cursor is moved to the beginning  of 
that line.  If the number specified is greater than the number of 
lines  in the file,  the cursor is moved to the last line of  the 
file and an error message is generated.

.20
Save Macros

The  save macro command lets you specify a file to which you  can 
write out current your current set of macros. The default name is LSE.MAC
which is automatically loaded when LSE is started up.  

There  may  be  10 macros active at any one  time.   The  default 
filename  extension for a macro is ".MAC". LSE will search your current 
directory for a macro file so that different default macro files may be kept
in different directories, if desired.

To invoke a keyboard macro, press Alt and a function key with the number of 
the macro (ie ALT-F1). To define a macro, press ALT and the number of the 
macro.
.21
Load Macros

The  load macro command asks you to specify a file that contains a set of
macros. The file LSE.MAC from the current directory is loaded when LSE
starts executing.

There  may  be  10 macros active at any one  time.   The  default 
filename  extension for a macro is ".MAC". LSE will search your current 
directory for a macro file so that different default macro files may be kept
in different directories, if desired.

To invoke a keyboard macro, press Alt and a function key with the number of 
the macro (ie ALT-F1). To define a macro, press ALT and the number of the 
macro.

.12

                     Open a New Window

When the open a new window command is executed,  you are prompted 
for a filename for text to read into the new window. If you hit
the Menu Key at this point, the file will be read as read only. The 
screen area of the current window is split in half and the window
is reframed to insure that the current character position  of the 
active  window is displayed.   The new window is opened  and  the 
cursor is placed at the first character position of the new text.

If you request the open a new window command when two windows are 
already open, an error message is displayed and editing continues 
in the window mode.

.16

                        Undo Command

When  the  undo command is executed,  the current undo buffer  is 
displayed  on the status line of the current window and  you  are 
prompted  as  to  whether you want that buffer  inserted  at  the 
current cursor position.

The  undo  buffer can hold only one line at a time and is  filled 
when  the memory allocated to hold a line buffer is  returned  to 
the  operating system.   It is designed to be used when a  single 
line has been accidentally deleted.
