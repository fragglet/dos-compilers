Summary
-------

WEDIT.DLL is a small DLL containing functions which control an editor from 
within another application.  Currently two Windows implementations exist - 
WEDITVIW.DLL for Watcom's VIW, and WEDITCW.DLL for Premia's Codewright.  
Both use DDE to talk to the editors. There is also an implementation which 
uses the EPM editor under OS/2.

Functions
---------

All functions return FALSE for success and TRUE for failure.  

int FAR PASCAL EDITConnect()
    
    Create a DDE connection to the editor.  If a DDE-enabled copy is
    not already running, WinExec one.  The app using the DLL is free
    to call this whenever it feels like it. 

int FAR PASCAL EDITFile( LPSTR szFilename, LPSTR szHelpFile )

    Load a file into the editor.  Many editors (including VIW and CW)
    will simply move to the file's window if it is already loaded.
    szHelpFile is either NULL or the name of a help file which is
    associated with the text file being loaded. Some editors are able
    to change the default help to look at this file instead of their
    normal editor-specific help. For example, when double clicking on
    a C++ error message, this string will specify the C++ help file
    name.
    
int FAR PASCAL EDITLocate( long lRow, int nCol, int nLen )

    Locate the caret at the given row and column in the current file.
    if nLen is > 0, also highlight nLen characters after this position. 

int FAR PASCAL EDITLocateError( long lRow, int nCol, int nLen, int idResource, LPSTR szErrMsg )

    Locate the caret at the given row and column in the current file.
    if nLen is > 0, also highlight nLen characters after this position. 
    idResource identifies the help text for the error message. Under OS/2, 
    it is a resource id and under Windows it is an integer which can be 
    used to specify the help context within WinHelp(). szErrMsg points 
    to the text for the error message which prompted this particular
    action.
    

int FAR PASCAL EDITShowWindow( int nCmdShow )

    Something akin to Windows' ShowWindow.  This restricted version 
    takes only SW_RESTORE (or SW_SHOWNORMAL) and SW_MINIMIZE.
    
int FAR PASCAL EDITDisconnect( void )

    Kill our DDE connection to the editor.  If we were forced to 
    WinExec one in the first place, also try to shut it down.  
    If the editor decides to give the user a choice on whether
    to stay alive, the user may choose this and the editor will
    not die (we can't know this - this function is always successful)
    
int FAR PASCAL EDITSaveFiles( void ) ( only for viw so far )

    Prompt the user whether or not to save for all modified files in the editor.

int FAR PASCAL EDITSaveThisFile( const char * ) ( only for viw so far )

    Save for file in the editor.

int FAR PASCAL EDITQueryThisFile( const char * ) ( only for viw so far )

    Query for file in the editor.

    
Using EditDLL
-------------

-   #include "wedit.h" in your code.  
    
-   link with the appropriate import library wedit.lib

-   have the appropriate DLL wedit.dll available to Windows/OS2.
